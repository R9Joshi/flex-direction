# flex-direction
This repository demonstrates the use of the flex-direction property in CSS Flexbox. It includes examples of row, row-reverse, column, and column-reverse layouts, showcasing how to arrange items within a flex container. This project is part of my learning journey from Angela Yuâ€™s Udemy course.
